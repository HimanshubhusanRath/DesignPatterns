Flyweight Design Pattern
-------------------------
* Used to separate the intrinsic state (attributes of an object which are constant/do not change over time) from the extrinsic state(attributes which
  are specific to that object and can be changed over time) of an object so that the intrinsic state can be reused by multiple objects. This intrinsic 
  state can also be thought as the common part between multiple objects.
  
* Used only if there is a limitation of processing memory for the application.
