Adapter Design Pattern
------------------------

Use case : 
----------
We have a DC electrical device which works on DC power source but currently we don't got only AC power source with us. So, we can not directly charge this
DC device using AC power source. Hence, we need to prepare an adapter which will convert AC to DC power source.

How it works:
--------------
* The adapter class instantiates the destination (DC power source) class. So now, adapter class IS-A 'DC power source'.
* Then the adapter class uses an AC power source object (composition). This is our source class.
* Now, the adapter class overrides the methods of DC power source and uses the data from AC power source object in this method.


In this way, data from one interface (AC power) is used for another interface (DC power).
