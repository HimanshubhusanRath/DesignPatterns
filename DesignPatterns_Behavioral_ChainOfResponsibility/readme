Chain Of Responsibility
------------------------
* Different handlers are chained together to execute in a proper sequence.
* Each handler can perform its operation and also can delegate the work to the next handler in the chain.
* Delegation to the next handler can be done before or after the execution of the current handler.
* The sequence of handlers can be defined either well in advance or can also be defined during runtime.
