Mediator Design Pattern
------------------------
* Define the individual entities which communicates with each other.
* Define a mediator containing the references to these individual entities.
* Add a reference to the mediator from these entity classes as well.
* The methods defined in the mediator interface ideally invoke the operations of the concerned entities.
* In this way, using this pattern, an entity invokes the mediator's method and that method invokes the concerned entity's method. 
* So, the communication happens between two entities in an indirect way (without coupling).
