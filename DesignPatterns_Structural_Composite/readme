Composite Design Pattern
------------------------

Use case : 
----------
* Class sturucute follows a hierarchial / tree style patterns where all the classes can be considered as originating from one interface (common behavior).
* In this scenario, there can be leaf classes as well as composite classes (which contains other leaf/composite classes).
* The objective is to perform some common operation on all the objects persent in this hierarchy where the client does not know the details of the implementaion classes.


Example considered here:
-------------------------
* We have got a lunch box (composite class) which contains either one/more lunch boxes OR leaf classes (rice/curry) inside it.
* We are interested in calculating the total price for the box which can be considered as the sum of the product(leaf)'s price and the packing charges 
  (applicable for the lunch boxes).
