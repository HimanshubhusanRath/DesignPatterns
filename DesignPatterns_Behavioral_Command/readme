Command Design Pattern
------------------------
* Define a class/interface which will represent the base for all types of actions.
* Define the actions as the implementation of this class.
* Define a class to whom these actions will be assigned to. Define a method in this class which accepts these actions and executes them.

THIS PATTERN CAN BE USED TO CONVERT ANY OPERATION INTO AN OBJECT WHERE THE OPERATION'S PARAMETERS BECOME THE FIELDS ON THAT OBJECT.
